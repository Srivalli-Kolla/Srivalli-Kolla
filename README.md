## Research & Professional Profile

My expertise is centered on **Bioinformatics** and **Computational Genomics**, demonstrated through rigorous academic research in single-cell biology and industry experience in clinical oncology. My work aims to translate high-dimensional data into clinical and biological insights.

### Current Focus: Computational Cardiac Biology (PhD)
* **Specialization:** **Decoding cardiac disease** at **single-cell and spatial resolution** . I leverage **scRNA-seq, snRNA-seq, and Spatial Transcriptomics** data to comprehensively map cellular heterogeneity and gene expression dynamics in mouse models of genetic cardiomyopathies.
* **Core Contribution:** **Designing and deploying robust bioinformatics pipelines** for the processing, integration, and interpretation of high-dimensional transcriptomic data. This rigorous analysis is essential for **identifying key cell states, regulatory networks, and novel disease signatures**.
* **Translational Impact:** My work directly **enhances our understanding of cardiovascular pathophysiology** and provides computational evidence to **support the discovery of novel therapeutic targets** for human heart disease.

### Prior Focus: Clinical Cancer Genomics (4baseCare)
* **Experience:** Applied computational methods to Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data, including **Whole-Exome Sequencing (WES)** analysis and **Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB)** calculations.
* **Key Contribution:** **Involved in the bioinformatics analysis** for a groundbreaking study on TMB in over **1,200 cancer patients from India**—one of the largest such efforts in South-East Asia—contributing directly to the first major publication of its kind.
* **Liquid Biopsy Expertise:** Developed specialized scripts and analytical pipelines for **cfDNA (cell-free DNA)** based cancer detection, focusing on clinically critical biomarkers like **Microsatellite Instability (MSI)**, **Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD)** scores, and **TMB** in liquid biopsy samples.
