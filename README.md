## Research & Professional Profile

My expertise is centered on **Bioinformatics** and **Computational Genomics**, demonstrated through rigorous academic research in single-cell biology and industry experience in clinical oncology. My work aims to translate high-dimensional data into clinical and biological insights.

### Current Focus: Computational Cardiac Biology (PhD)
* **Specialization:** **Decoding cardiac disease** at **single-cell and spatial resolution** . I leverage **scRNA-seq, snRNA-seq, and Spatial Transcriptomics** data to comprehensively map cellular heterogeneity and gene expression dynamics in mouse models of genetic cardiomyopathies.
* **Core Contribution:** **Designing and deploying robust bioinformatics pipelines** for the processing, integration, and interpretation of high-dimensional transcriptomic data. This rigorous analysis is essential for **identifying key cell states, regulatory networks, and novel disease signatures**.
* **Translational Impact:** My work directly **enhances our understanding of cardiovascular pathophysiology** and provides computational evidence to **support the discovery of novel therapeutic targets** for human heart disease.

### Prior Focus: Clinical Cancer Genomics (4baseCare)
* **Experience:** Applied computational methods to Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data, including **Whole-Exome Sequencing (WES)** analysis and **Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB)** calculations.
* **Key Contribution:** **Involved in the bioinformatics analysis** for a groundbreaking study on TMB in over **1,200 cancer patients from India**—one of the largest such efforts in South-East Asia—contributing directly to the first major publication of its kind.
* **Liquid Biopsy Expertise:** Developed specialized scripts and analytical pipelines for **cfDNA (cell-free DNA)** based cancer detection, focusing on clinically critical biomarkers like **Microsatellite Instability (MSI)**, **Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD)** scores, and **TMB** in liquid biopsy samples.

## Technical Expertise & Analytical Workflow

My skills reflect the ability to manage and analyze complex, high-dimensional biological datasets using robust computational practices.

### Core Tool Stack
| Domain | Key Tools & Languages | Experience Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Programming** | **Python**, **R** (Bioconductor), Shell Scripting | Advanced |
| **Single-Cell Analysis** | **Seurat**, **Scanpy**, **MiloR**, **LIANA** (CellPhoneDB, NATMI) | Advanced |
| **Genomics** | **scRNA-seq/snRNA-seq**, **Spatial Transcriptomics (Visium)**, WES, NGS | Advanced |

### Advanced Single-Cell Analytical Workflow

I employ a justified, multi-step pipeline for all single-nucleus/single-cell transcriptomic projects:

1.  **Normalization & Clustering (Seurat/SCTransform):**
    * Utilize **SCTransform** for effective normalization in snRNA-seq data, addressing technical variability while preserving critical biological signals.
    * Perform PCA and **Louvain clustering at multiple resolutions** to ensure the capture of modular data structure and biologically coherent cell populations.
2.  **Cell Annotation (DEG-Driven):**
    * Annotation is based rigorously on **marker gene expression** and **Differential Gene Expression (DEG) analysis** within the dataset, prioritizing dataset-specific biology over potentially misleading reference-based methods.
3.  **Pathway Analysis (Pseudobulk & GSEA):**
    * Employs **pseudobulk analysis** to aggregate gene counts per cell type, increasing statistical power and enabling robust, cell-type-specific pathway identification via **Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)**.
4.  **Compositional Analysis (MiloR):**
    * Utilize **MiloR** for label-free compositional analysis, leveraging local neighborhood structure to detect subtle differences in cell population abundances across conditions that standard proportion tests might miss.
5.  **Cell–Cell Communication (LIANA):**
    * **LIANA** is used to provide robust predictions of intercellular signaling by integrating multiple ligand–receptor inference methods, enabling clear visualization and mechanistic understanding of interacting cell types/subtypes.
