## Research & Professional Profile

My expertise is centered on **Bioinformatics** and **Computational Genomics**, demonstrated through rigorous academic research in single-cell cardiac biology and industry experience in clinical oncology. My work aims to translate high-dimensional data into clinical and biological insights.

### Current Focus: Computational Cardiac Transcriptomics (PhD)

* **Scientific Mandate:** I am dedicated to **decoding the molecular and cellular drivers of genetic cardiomyopathies** at **single-cell and spatial resolution**. This involves leveraging and integrating **scRNA-seq, snRNA-seq, and Spatial Transcriptomics** data to comprehensively map cellular heterogeneity and gene expression dynamics in disease models.
* **Methodological Rigor:** I design and deploy end-to-end **robust, scalable bioinformatics pipelines** for the processing, integration, and interpretation of high-dimensional transcriptomic data. The analysis is centered on:
    * **Identifying novel cell states** and defining cell-type-specific **Differential Gene Expression (DEG)**.
    * **Mapping cell-cell communication networks** (using **LIANA**) and predicting Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs).
    * **Performing compositional and spatial analysis (MiloR, Visium)** to contextualize molecular findings within the tissue microenvironment.
* **Translational Impact:** By establishing comprehensive cellular and spatial maps in clinically relevant mouse models, my work directly **enhances the mechanistic understanding of cardiovascular pathophysiology**. The computational evidence generated is critical for validating disease mechanisms and **accelerating the discovery and prioritization of novel therapeutic targets** for human heart disease.

### Prior Focus: Clinical Cancer Genomics (4baseCare)

* **Experience:** Applied computational methods to Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data, including **Whole-Exome Sequencing (WES)** analysis and **Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB)** calculations.
* **Key Contribution:** **Involved in the bioinformatics analysis** for a groundbreaking study on TMB in over **1,200 cancer patients from India**â€”one of the largest such efforts in South-East Asiaâ€”contributing directly to the first major publication of its kind.
* **Liquid Biopsy Expertise:** Developed specialized scripts and analytical pipelines for **cfDNA (cell-free DNA)** based cancer detection, focusing on clinically critical biomarkers like **Microsatellite Instability (MSI)**, **Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD)** scores, and **TMB** in liquid biopsy samples.
